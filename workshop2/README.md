```

**One real failure**

Category: Version conflict

Root cause: the full declared dependency set is not resolvable for Python 3.8 because the optional export extra includes keras>=3.5.0,<=3.12.0, which requires Python >=3.9 / >=3.10 depending on version. So the effective minimum for the full dependency set is Python 3.9+, while the repo metadata still says >=3.8.

Minimal fix: change to Python 3.10

**AI agent check**

Which AI coding agent did you use?: copilot

What did it change?: only venv python version

How did you verify the change?: I asked it to do this
